# learnBTC
## Vision Statement
The goal of learnBTC is to provide a better qualitative method of analyzing bitcoin price trends to social activity on Twitter. The purpose of learnBTC is as an independent analysis tool for understanding the relationship between bitcoin price and Twitter activity. Twitter activity was selected to understand the true scope and impact of Bitcoin on the general population. This Twitter activity represents a sampled portion of the population in order to see how relevant, prevalent, and active BTC actually is to the entire population. Thus, we will be able to meaningfully investigate the relationship between Twitter activity and bitcoin price fluctuations.

## Overview
The application supports two main views: Bitcoin price view and Twitter data view. Application grabs live Twitter data based on specified time periods, which is displayed on the Twitter data view.

## Feature List
### Bitcoin Price Graph
* Display graph of BTC price over a domain of dates and a codomain of BTC price. 
  * Parse and store BTC price data from .csv files
  * Pan and zoom gestures for manipulating domain of dates
  * Drag gesture to hover over BTC price values
  * Tap gesture or releasing drag gesture will select a specific point or range within the graph
  * Inputable and labelled textboxes for start and end date to change the range of dates
  * Swipe right gesture to segue to Twitter Data Analytics View

### Twitter Data Analytics View
* See basic statistics (frequency, total volume of tweets, most frequent words, most mentioned users, most used hashtags) for a specific date.
  * Parse and store Twitter data from .json files
  * Connect to Twitter API through UtterKit
  * Users will be able to select a point on the graph, and then segue (via a right swipe) to a new Table View with the aforementioned statistics.

## Domain Analysis
The underlying domain is the range of bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related topics and terms.

For each point in time when the user clicks on a point, the background controller will do search calls for a list of terms and words by doing calls to Twitter API through the UtterKit. The bitcoin price will be stored internally for a fixed set of dates; as there is no iOS kit for grabbing live bitcoin prices, a web grabber is planned for future implementation.

For the beginning of the project, we will gather canned Twitter data by grabbing tweets with relevant keywords from Twitter's Streaming API. The relevant keywords are: 'bitcoin', 'cryptocurrency', 'ethereum', and 'BTC'. Historic bitcoin price data will be taken from bitcoincharts.com and stored as a .csv file that is parsed.


## Architecture
### Independent Components
#### Twitter Mining
In order to have enough canned data to sufficiently run the program without access to
calls to Twitter's API, Twitter data was mined with a Python script that connected
to Twitter's Streaming API and filtered for the following keywords: 'bitcoin', 'cryptocurrency', 
'ethereum', 'BTC'. A parser will be written to translate the data into the program's abstract 
state. Currently, data is saved in a .txt file, being a continuous stream of Tweets encapsulated in
.json and they will be consolidated by date into a single .json file for each day.

In order to connect and scrape data from Twitter's Streaming API, run the following
command in terminal. The script will take data over a seven day period. 
Technical Note: running the script in a virtual environment is suggested.

```shell
python twitter_streaming.py > twitter_data.txt
```

Canned data was further broken down into <100 MB files to accommodate Githubâ€™s file size limitations.

#### Historic Bitcoin Price Data Collection
As a public and free BTC price API has not been discovered yet to do GET requests for historic data, this price data was manually collected from bitcoincharts.com and saved as a .csv file that will be parsed and interpreted by the application. 

### Main Architecture
#### learnBTC
Currently, there are three major components that have been built:
- Twitter Interpreter that translates .json files containing historic Twitter data and 
converting it into its internal abstract representation. 
- GraphViewController that displays a line graph detailing the changes to bitcoin (BTC)
price over a range of time. (Technical Note: this will NOT be the GraphView or GraphADT,
unless both were modified/rewritten accordingly to fit the new specifications.)
- DataViewController that displays a small pop-up giving basic Twitter data analysis
and potentially random "highlighted" Tweets when prompted for regarding the topic. 

The data abstraction will most likely be a large internal array of Tweets (sorted by
time, most likely) for each topic followed by bisections of this array when a 
range of dates are provided. Random, highlighted Tweets will simply be accessing single
elements of the array so O(1) time, and creating basic Twitter data analysis will be
linearly going through the entire array of Tweets so O(n) time. Specifically,
the density of Tweets (the number of Tweets at particular times)--maybe calculating
the derivative of the volume of Tweets mapped to time at moments--, the total volume of Tweets, 
the top ten (or some arbitrary number like five) most frequently used words (excluding pronouns,
articles, and other words with little to no meaning and relevance).

Later on, an expensive operation could be implemented would be to continuously go through the data
and update the strength of relations between changes to BTC price and most frequent.
This would be to study the potential effects of "buzz-words" such as "crashing", 
"decrease", "increase", etc.
